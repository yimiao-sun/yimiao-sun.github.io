        "abstract": "As a key enabling technology of the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G communication networks, millimeter wave (mmWave) backscatter has undergone noteworthy advancements and brought significant improvement to prevailing sensing and communication systems. Past few years have witnessed growing efforts in innovating mmWave backscatter transmitters (e.g., tags and metasurfaces) and the corresponding techniques, which provide efficient information embedding and fine-grained signal manipulation for mmWave backscatter technologies. These efforts have greatly enabled a variety of appealing applications, such as long-range localization, roadside-to-vehicle communication, coverage optimization and large-scale identification. In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive survey to systematically summarize the works related to the topic of mmWave backscatter. Firstly, we introduce the scope of this survey and provide a taxonomy to distinguish two categories of mmWave backscatter research based on the operating principle of the backscatter transmitter: modulation-based and relay-based. Furthermore, existing works in each category are grouped and introduced in detail, with their common applications, platforms and technologies, respectively. Finally, we elaborate on potential directions and discuss related surveys in this area."

        "abstract": "As an emerging technology, WiFi sensing has garnered widespread attention in recent years. However, due to limitations in WiFi bandwidth and hardware capacity, multi-target sensing with WiFi remains an unresolved issue. In this paper, we present SLINGSHOT, a first-of-its-kind approach for multitargetWiFi sensing enabled by metasurface. SLINGSHOT exploits a metasurface’s ability of beam scanning to periodically scan among targets in a high frequency, so their sensing signals can be separated in the time domain. However, the WiFi-initiated and the metasurface-initiated signals will interfere with each other, which could significantly degrade the sensing accuracy. Moreover, the WiFi devices and the metasurface operate in a distributed manner, so the inherent clock offset and clock drift among them make it difficult to accurately separate the sensing signals of the targets. To address the above challenges, SLINGSHOT leverages the metasurface’s ability of phase shifting to cancel interfering signals and designs a passive clock synchronization scheme to synchronize the metasurface and WiFi devices. We implement SLINGSHOT and evaluate it under various settings. Results show that SLINGSHOT can sense up to 8 targets. Respectively compared to the state-of-the-art methods, SLINGSHOT has 6.75 % higher mean accuracy in activity recognition and 58.34 % lower mean error in respiration monitoring."

        "abstract": "WiFi-based device localization is a key enabling technology for smart applications, which has attracted numerous research studies in the past decade. Most of the existing approaches rely on Line-of-Sight (LoS) signals to work, while a critical problem is often neglected: In the real-world indoor environments, WiFi signals are everywhere, but very few of them are usable for accurate localization. As a result, the localization accuracy in practice is far from being satisfactory. This paper presents BIFROST, a novel hardware-software co-design for accurate indoor localization. The core idea of BIFROST is to reinvent WiFi signals, so as to provide sufficient LoS signals for localization. This is realized by exploiting the dispersion effect of signals emitted by the leaky wave antenna (LWA). We present a low-cost plug-in design of LWA that can generate orthogonal polarized signals: On one hand, LWA disperses signals of different frequencies to different angles, thus providing Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) information for the localized target. On the other hand, the target further leverages the antenna polarization mismatch to distinguish AoAs from different LWAs. In the software layer, fine-grained information in Channel State Information (CSI) is exploited to cope with multipath and noise. We implement BIFROST and evaluate its performance under various settings. The results show that the median localization error of BIFROST is 0.81m, which is 52.35% less than that of SpotFi, a state-of-the-art approach. SpotFi, when combined with BIFROST to work in the realistic settings, can reduce the localization error by 33.54%."

Existing approaches remain limited to time-division operations and fail to read multiple tags simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce QuinID, the first frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) RFID system to achieve fully parallel reading. We innovatively exploit the frequency selectivity of the tag antenna rather than a conventional digital FDMA, bypassing the power and circuitry constraint of RFID tags. Specifically, we delicately design the frequency-selective antenna based on surface acoustic wave (SAW) components to achieve extreme narrow-band response, so that QuinID tags (i.e., QuinTags) operate exclusively within their designated frequency bands. By carefully designing the matching network and canceling various interference, a customized QuinReader communicates simultaneously with multiple QuinTags across distinct bands. QuinID maintains high compatibility with commercial RFID systems and presents a tag cost of less than 10 cents. We implement a 5-band QuinID system and evaluate its performance under various settings. The results demonstrate a fivefold increase in read rate, reaching up to 5000 reads per second."

Unlike traditional speakers that emit sound waves in all directions, Meta-Speaker can manipulate the granularity of the audible region, down to a single point, and can manipulate the location of the source. Additionally, the source projected by Meta-Speaker is a physical presence in space, allowing both humans and machines to perceive it with spatial awareness. Meta-Speaker achieves this by leveraging the fact that air is a nonlinear medium, which enables the reproduction of audible sources from ultrasounds. Meta-Speaker comprises two distributed ultrasonic arrays, each transmitting a narrow ultrasonic beam. The audible source can be reproduced at the intersection of the beams. We present a comprehensive profiling of Meta-Speaker to validate the high manipulability it offers. We prototype Meta-Speaker and demonstrate its potential through three applications: anchor-free localization with a median error of 0.13 m, location-aware communication with a throughput of 1.28 Kbps, and acoustic augmented reality where users can perceive source direction with a mean error of 9.8 degrees."

In order to achieve a sustained transmission, low-power wireless technology such as backscatter has been widely considered. However, existing backscatter systems encounter difficulties in audio transmissions due to the high power consumption from the complicated digital processing and fast frequency-shifting clocks. In this paper, we propose Satori, the first-of-its-kind in-band analog backscatter system for audio transmission with ultra-low power consumption. Satori eliminates the need for in-place digital processing by directly embedding analog audio voltages into backscattered WiFi symbols through analog modulation. It also avoids the power consumption of the frequency-shifting clock by transmitting the audio within the excitation WiFi signal's frequency band. We implement the Satori prototype and evaluate it under various settings. The experimental results indicate that Satori achieves audio transmission with a SNR greater than 18 dB. Meanwhile, the ASIC solution consumes only 9.3μW, 3.3× lower than the existing backscatter systems for audio transmission."

        "abstract": "We present MicNest: an acoustic localization system enabling precise landing of aerial drones. Drone landing is a crucial step in a drone's operation, especially as high-bandwidth wireless networks, such as 5G, enable beyond-line-of-sight operation in a shared airspace and applications such as instant asset delivery with drones gain traction. In MicNest, multiple microphones are deployed on a landing platform in carefully devised configurations. The drone carries a speaker transmitting purposefully-designed acoustic pulses. The drone may be localized as long as the pulses are correctly detected. Doing so is challenging: i) because of limited transmission power, propagation attenuation, background noise, and propeller interference, the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of received pulses is intrinsically low; ii) the pulses experience non-linear Doppler distortion due to the physical drone dynamics while airborne; iii) as location information is to be used during landing, the processing latency must be reduced to effectively feed the flight control loop. To tackle these issues, we design a novel pulse detector, Matched Filter Tree (MFT), whose idea is to convert pulse detection to a tree search problem. We further present three practical methods to accelerate tree search jointly. Our real-world experiments show that MicNest is able to localize a drone 120 m away with 0.53% relative localization error at 20 Hz location update frequency."
