        "abstract": "The emerging integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technologies show great potential for 5G NR, offering a new wireless-sensing infrastructure paradigm. Users can benefit from pervasive sensing applications in various scenarios without communication penalties. Given the diverse demands for sensing resources across different sensing tasks, elastic resource scheduling becomes crucial, particularly when resources are constrained. However, existing approaches often treat users equally, limiting the applicability in dealing with diverse sensing tasks in the real world. In this paper, we introduce ElaSe, a pioneering sensing technique that enables elastic and prompt scheduling of sensing resources. At the core of ElaSe is the exploration of the user’s state to precisely determine the sensing resource requirements and schedule resources accordingly. We build the first model for matching sensing resources with sensing demands, and further propose a predictive scheduling scheme to eliminate delays by leveraging the 5G virtualized radio access network (vRAN). ElaSe has been implemented on a CPU-based 5G vRAN and commercial 5G user equipments. We conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of ElaSe under different settings. The results demonstrate that ElaSe outperforms the non-scheduling scheme, with a 34% reduction in trajectory tracking error and a 92% decrease in resource allocation error."

The built-in sensors can easily collect personal information like locations, activities, vital signs, and social connections, giving birth to a new class of sensing applications - Human-Centric Sensing. Compared with traditional sensing methods, such as wearable-based sensing, vision-based sensing, wireless signal-based sensing, etc., millimeter wave (mmWave) signals have a series of advantages, such as high accuracy, non-line-of-sight, passive sensing (no need to carry sensors), high resolution, easy deployment, and good environmental robustness. mmWave-based sensing has become a research hotspot in academia and industry in recent years, and it can realize the non-contact fine-grained perception of human activities and physical signs. Based on the survey of recent studies, this paper first analyzes the background and research significance of mmWave-based human sensing. This paper categorizes existing methods into four classes including tracking and positioning, motion recognition, biometrics measurement, and human imaging, and introduces commonly used publicly available datasets. Finally the potential research challenges and future directions are discussed, which is promising to achieve accurate, ubiquitous, and stable human perception."

However, in real-world indoor environments, very few LoS signals are usable for accurate localization. This paper presents Bifrost, a novel hardware-software co-design to cope with this practical problem. The core idea of Bifrost is to reinvent WiFi signals to provide sufficient LoS signals. Specifically, we present a low-cost plug-in design of leaky wave antenna (LWA) that can generate orthogonal polarized signals: On one hand, LWA disperses signals of different frequencies to different angles, thus providing AoA information for the localized target. On the other hand, the target further leverages the antenna polarization mismatch to distinguish AoAs from different LWAs. Besides, fine-grained information in CSI is exploited to mitigate multipath and noise. Besides, a dedicated Kalman filter is proposed to facilitate the cooperation of Bifrost and SpotFi, a state-of-the-art approach, to enhance the availability and accuracy of SpotFi. The evaluation results show that the median localization error of Bifrost is 0.81m, 52.35% less than that of SpotFi. When combined with Bifrost to work in realistic settings, SpotFi can reduce the localization error by 33.54%."

Particularly in monitoring abnormal behaviors, such as falls, traditional methods rely on repeated human experiments, which not only poses safety risks but also raises ethical concerns. To address these issues, this paper proposes a time-domain digital coding metasurface-assisted data acquisition method. By simulating the Doppler effect and micro-Doppler characteristics of the human body, the time-domain digital coding metasurface can effectively replace human experiments and assist in constructing Wi-Fi sensing datasets. To verify the feasibility of this method, we develop a time-domain digital coding metasurface with 0°–360° full-phase modulation capability. Experimental results show that the signals generated by the metasurface retain the motion characteristics of the human body, complement real samples, reduce the complexity of data collection, and finally improve the monitoring accuracy of the classification model significantly. This method provides an innovative and feasible solution for data acquisition for Wi-Fi sensing technology."

Recognition of human activities intrinsically demands to be real-time and continuous, but the state of the arts is still far limited with the capacity in this regard. The main obstacle lies in activity sequence segmentation, i.e., locating the boundaries between consecutive activities in an activity sequence. This is a daunting task, due to the unclear activity boundaries and the variable activity duration. In this paper, we propose ZuMa , the first mmWave-based approach to real-time continuous activity recognition. When resorting to a machine learning model for activity recognition, our insight is that the recognition confidence of the recognition model is highly correlated to the accuracy of activity sequence segmentation, so that the former can be utilized as a feedback metric to finely adjust the segmentation boundaries. Based on this insight, ZuMa is a coarse-to-fine grained approach, which includes the fast coarse-grained activity chunk extraction and the find-grained explicit segmentation adjustment and recognition. We have implemented ZuMa with the commercial mmWave radar and evaluated its performance under various settings. The results demonstrate that ZuMa achieves an average recognition error of 12.67%, which is 65.08% and 71.87% lower than that of the two baseline methods. The average recognition delay of ZuMa is only 1.86s."

To fully cover numerous tags in the deployment area, one often needs to deploy multiple readers, each of which communicates with tags within its communication range. However, the actual backscattered signals from a tag are likely to reach a reader outside its communication range and cause interference. Conventional TDMA or CSMA based approaches for interference avoidance separate readers’ media access in time, leading to limited network throughput. In this paper, we propose Trident, a novel backscatter design that enables interference avoidance via frequency-space division. By incorporating a tunable bandpass filter and multiple terminal loads, a Tridenttag can detect its channel condition and adaptively adjust the frequency and the power of its backscattered signals. We further propose a frequency assignment algorithm for the readers. With these designs, all the readers in the network can operate concurrently without being interfered. We implement Tridentand evaluate its performance under various settings. The results demonstrate that Tridentenhances the network throughput by 3.18 × , compared to the TDMA-based scheme."

A UAV can shoot photos at height, but how to detect such an uninvited intruder is an open problem. This paper presents mmHawkeye, a passive approach for non-cooperative UAV detection and identification with a COTS millimeter wave (mmWave) radar. mmHawkeye doesn’t require prior knowledge of the type, motions, and flight trajectory of the UAV, while exploiting the signal feature induced by the UAV’s periodic micro-motion (PMM) for long-range accurate detection. The design is therefore effective in dealing with low-SNR and uncertain reflected signals from the UAV. After analyzing the theoretical model of the PMM feature, mmHawkeye can further track the UAV’s position containing range, azimuth and altitude angle with dynamic programming and particle filtering, and then identify it with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based detector. We implement mmHawkeye on a commercial mmWave radar and evaluate its performance under varied settings. The experimental results show that mmHawkeye has a detection accuracy of 95.8% and can realize detection at a range up to 80m."

Indoor drone localization and tracking are arguably a crucial, yet unsolved challenge: in GPS-denied environments, existing approaches enjoy limited applicability, especially in Non-Line of Sight (NLoS), require extensive environment instrumentation, or demand considerable hardware/software changes on drones. In contrast, AIM exploits the acoustic characteristics of the drones to estimate their location and derive their motion, even in NLoS settings. We tame location estimation errors using a dedicated Kalman filter and the Interquartile Range rule (IQR) and demonstrate that AIM can support indoor spaces with arbitrary ranges and layouts. We implement AIM using an off-the-shelf microphone array and evaluate its performance with a commercial drone under varied settings. Results indicate that the mean localization error of AIM is 46% lower than that of commercial UWB-based systems in a complex 10m×10m indoor scenario, where state-of-the-art infrared systems would not even work because of NLoS situations. When distributed microphone arrays are deployed, the mean error can be reduced to less than 0.5m in a 20m range, and even support spaces with arbitrary ranges and layouts."

In MicNest , multiple microphones are deployed on a landing platform in carefully devised configurations. The drone carries a speaker transmitting purposefully-designed acoustic pulses. The drone may be localized as long as the pulses are correctly detected. Doing so is challenging: i) because of limited transmission power, propagation attenuation, background noise, and propeller interference, the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of received pulses is intrinsically low; ii) the pulses experience non-linear Doppler distortion due to the physical drone dynamics; iii) as location information is used during landing, the processing latency must be reduced to effectively feed the flight control loop. To tackle these issues, we design a novel pulse detector, Matched Filter Tree (MFT), whose idea is to convert pulse detection to a tree search problem. We further present three practical methods to accelerate tree search jointly. Our experiments show that MicNest can localize a drone 120 m away with 0.53% relative localization error at 20 Hz location update frequency.
